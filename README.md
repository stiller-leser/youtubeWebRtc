YouTube with WebRTC
===================

This project aims to make YouTube more social. One partner can choose
a video and send the link, provided by this project to his or her partner.
They will each see the same window and can now chat with each other and
even make a video call, currently with no sound though.
Pretending one partner stops a video, the video will stop for the other
one aswell. To realize the connection and simplify the process this
projects uses peerJS.
